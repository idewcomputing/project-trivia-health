# 1 HTML Quick Start

## HTML Basics

HTML provides the structure for web pages and uses _elements_ with _tag names_ to differentiate items on the page. For example, `<h1>...</h1>` is a large heading element. Notice the _opening tag_ `<h1>` and _closing tag_ `</h2>` that indicates the beginning and end of the element.  "h1" is the tag name in this case.
