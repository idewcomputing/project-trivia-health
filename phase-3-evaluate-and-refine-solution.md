| :---: | :--- |
|  | **Create an evaluation script.** Plan how you will approach and prompt people to test your trivia app, followed by a clear method of record keeping. You want to learn as much as you can while using people's time wisely and respectfully. |
|  | **Execute your evaluation.** Remember, you may want to adjust your evaluation plan based on what you learn from the early participants. |
|  | **Summarize your findings and draw conclusions about design refinements.** It is important to determine how you can get the most return \(improvements in the trivia game\) from the time you have remaining to work. |
|  | **Make refinements to your trivia code and visual design as needed.** Determine a plan to iterate through your changes with frequent testing to ensure nothing is unintentionally broken. |
|  | **Complete a question analysis.** Prepare summary data and charts on people's responses to your trivia questions and draw some conclusions about the quality of the questions or people's general knowledge about each item. |
|  | **Prepare your poster.** Your poster design is important for two reasons. One, it is an opportunity for your team to reflect on the project process and what you have learned. Two, it provides a great visual aid to explaining your work to visitors at the final event. |
|  | **Prepare for your in-class poster review and final trivia demonstration.** This is a time to develop a clear narrative to share about your team's work and enjoy sharing it with others. |
