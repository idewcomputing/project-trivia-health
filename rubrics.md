| **A prototype** is provided but lacks detail to make the evaluation fruitful, not demonstrating a unique visual or interactive perspective on the basic trivia template design. | A prototype that demonstrates thoughtful concept design and provides a good representation of idea for feedback from participants. | A prototype that is exceptional in representing and evaluating some novel concepts in an efficent way for participants, or a couple variations of a prototype are presented to test alternate concepts. |
| **An evaluation** is presented but doesn't communicate any added value to the team's development process. | An evaluation that produces valuable insights on improving and developing the team's concept. | An evaluation that is exhaustive and thoughtful in collecting as much useful information from participants while be respectful of their time. |
| **A marketing card** is complete but is very basic and lacks cohesion with the overall team's project. | A marketing card conveying a consistent visual and narrative story with the game concept that will clearly generate interest in the game. | A marketing card with an exceptionally engaging and visual message to try the trivia game. |

| **The live trivia app** is functioning, but the style and/or content has been developed very little from the base template provided. | The app demonstrates intentional design and styling consistent with the team's concept and goals. The app code and features demonstrate a customized interaction that largely functions as desired. | The app is clearly a work of diligent and thoughtful work that goes beyond the base requirements for the project. |
