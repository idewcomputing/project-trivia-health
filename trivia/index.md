# Trivia for Impoved Health and Wellness

> ##### Challenge
> ### Develop a web-based trivia app to raise awareness of an important health issue in your community.

### Teams

Teams of 3 students will collaborate to build a web-based trivia app. Each team will practice collaboration techniques and be responsible for determining member roles, maintaining good communication, ensuring equitable contributions, and providing clear project updates to the class in a timely manner

### Recommended Production Tools

* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) - for team file management and Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings.
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io) - For code practice exercises. Also, _CodePen Projects_ is a potential choice as a code editor for the trivia project.
* [Marvel App](https://marvelapp.com) - A digital prototyping tool.

### Final Deliverables

Each stage of the project has a set of deliverables, but they lead up to the following final deliverables from the team.

- **A public trivia app** that has been tested, refined, and prepared for demonstration at the end event.
  * At least four categories of questions related to a community health issue(s).
  * At least 40 total questions.
  * A distinct style created by the team.
  * A countdown mechanism that encourages each player’s engagement.
  * A metric that provides the player with feedback on his or her performance.
  * At least two sound effects.
  * At least two images or advanced visual effects.
- **A poster** (2’ x 3’) summarizing the process of creating your trivia app (including artifacts created, like sketches, prototypes etc.), along with defining features of the final design.
- **A marketing card** (3” x 5”) that promotes your team’s trivia game with classmates and the community.
- **A well-coordinated presentation** that demonstrates the trivia app and explains the process of developing it to visitors of your school.
- **A prepared personal perspective** for you, as an individual, to share your unique responsibilities and experiences during the project, including how your future goals and interests have been shaped.

## Phase 1: Discover and Define Problem
Begin to frame the goals of the design by learning about the stakeholders, the available technology, the features of existing trivia designs, and the scope of health issues in your community. Develop some initial design ideas and compose a clear problem statement that defines what your team will create for whom and the value it will bring. Finally, you will present a proposal to your class and the community for feedback and refinement of your design direction.

| Tasks |
| :--- |
| **Complete the trivia app code experiments.**<br>Each team member complete the experiments to develop a firm understanding of the opportunities and constraints your team will have with your design. | 
| **Complete a competitive analysis.** <br>Each team member contribute one competitive analysis of a trivia game and synthesize findings from the code template experiments.| 
| **Research health issues related to your community.**<br>Each team member will research at least one health issue to understand the scope of each problem (like trends, statistics, and causal relationships) and the opportunities to affect public awareness. The team can share findings to consider how the trivia game may engage these topics. | 
| **Develop pesonas based on interviews.**<br>Conduct interviews in order to develop personas, one for each team member, that describe the frustrations of stakeholders and opportunities to support meaningful change.| 
| **Sketch initial interaction storyboards.**<br>Each team member create a unique design concept based on your understanding about the stakeholders, the trivia code, and a health topic. | 
| **Compose a clear problem statement.**<br>As a team, review all of your work and discuss several possible problem statement before settling in on one single problem statement. You will want this statement to be clear, consise, and compelling. It should be supported by your research and anlysis up to this point. | 
| **Prepare for your team proposal.**<br>Refine your artifacts to be included in your proposal submission. Ensure that they present a cohesive story that supports your problem statement and be prepared to discuss your team's work and ideas in more detail. |

## Phase 2: Design and Build Solution
Compose a prototype of the solution for a detailed internal review and evaluation by a sample of stakeholders. Prepare any other known assets that will contribute to the development in the next phase. Organize a development strategy to methodically create your solution with efficiency and quality. While executing the development, also prepare for the promotion and launch of the solution. Conduct several tests to ensure all is in working order before an in-class demonstration.
