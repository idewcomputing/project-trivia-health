# Project: *Trivia for Impoved Health and Wellness*

> ##### Challenge
> ### Develop a web-based trivia app to raise awareness of an important health issue in your community.

### Teams

Teams of 3 students will collaborate to build a web-based trivia app. Each team will practice collaboration techniques and be responsible for determining member roles, maintaining good communication, ensuring equitable contributions, and providing clear project updates to the class in a timely manner

### Final Deliverables

Each stage of the project has a set of deliverables, but they lead up to the following final deliverables from the team.

- **A public trivia app** that has been tested, refined, and prepared for demonstration at the end event.
  * At least four categories of questions related to a community health issue(s).
  * At least 40 total questions.
  * A distinct style created by the team.
  * A countdown mechanism that encourages each player’s engagement.
  * A metric that provides the player with feedback on his or her performance.
  * At least two sound effects.
  * At least two images or advanced visual effects.
- **A poster** (2’ x 3’) summarizing the process of creating your trivia app (including artifacts created, like sketches, prototypes etc.), along with defining features of the final design.
- **A marketing card** (3” x 5”) that promotes your team’s trivia game with classmates and the community.
- **A well-coordinated presentation** that demonstrates the trivia app and explains the process of developing it to visitors of your school.
- **A prepared personal perspective** for you, as an individual, to share your unique responsibilities and experiences during the project, including how your future goals and interests have been shaped.

# Learning Objectives

### Why Do This Project?
Of course you are going to create an awesome trivia game to benefit others, but you will also get first-hand experience in informatics and computing that reflect great opportunities in the field. You will...
* **Build skills** in the digital arts, programming, and data.
* **Collaborate with a team** where tech skills, people skills, and design skills overlap.
* **Increase your intuition, confidence, and curiosity** in solving problems using a ‘*design, build and test*’ pattern common with scientific thinking, creative thinking, and critical thinking.

### What's Different About This?

This is different than learning from a textbook. While you are encouraged to complete tutorials in a particular skill area to build expertise, this project will challenge you in the following ways.
* **Independent and Interdependent Learning** - You will often have to search out information on your own, experiment, make mistakes, and try again. You will also do this in groups with peers, mentors, teachers, and professionals.
* **Managing Ambiguity** - Since you will be creating a unique solution, you will not be given a recipe on how to complete many tasks. You will often evaluate the context of problems quickly and decide on a plan of action that makes sense.
* **Collaborating** - You will have to be a productive team member, fulfilling a role, communicating clearly, and valuing each team member's views at decision points.
* **Presentation** - Your team will often present work to the class, and occasionally to visitors, to get feedback and share ideas with other teams.

### Key Concepts

You will investigate the following key concepts related to computing.

|Information Structure|Information Presentation|Information Processing|
|:----|:----|:----|
|How computers can store and represent information. ```HTML, Spreadsheet Tables, and CSV files``` | How humans see and organize information, and how to create visual interfaces. ```Interface design, CSS, Data Charts, and Illustration``` | How humans make decisions and choose actions, and how computers process data and interactions. ```Interaction Design, Task Analysis, JavaScript, Spreadsheet Functions, Descriptive Statistics``` |

### Key Practices

| Critical and Computational Thinking | Creative Thinking | Collaboration + Communication |
|:---|:---|:---|
|You will practice independent-learning to become confident in obtaining valuable information and understanding the leverage computers can offer to solve problems. | You will often use divergent thinking and a “design, build, test” cycle that supports an agile environment rooted in the scientific method and common creative processes. | You will thoughtfully reflect on techniques and attitudes for successful collaboration and communication in project groups, as well as sharing your work with those outside of class.|

### Implementation Suggestions

While this digital book guides your project work, below are important suggestions for a well-rounded learning experience using supplemental activities.

**Skill Building** - Include independent learning time in the three core areas of digital arts, programming, and data. Use online tutorials like CodeHS, Codecademy, and Kahn Academy to learn at your own pace. Try learning in each of the three core areas breifly. Then "specialize" in one.

**Exploration and Discovery** - Opportunities to discover the larger world of opportunities in technology are important.
* Visits from industry professionals and visiting companies are great for exposure.
* Create reports on "Tech Trends" or "Tech Careers" to research your specific interests and curiosities. Provide written reports and presentations to your class, so all students benefit from your findings.

**Weekly Schedule** - A predictable pattern to the week may help. For example...

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Project | Project | Project | Independent Skills | Visitors & Exploration Reports |

## Phase 1: Discover and Define Problem
Begin to frame the goals of the design by learning about the stakeholders, the available technology, the features of existing trivia designs, and the scope of health issues in your community. Develop some initial design ideas and compose a clear problem statement that defines what your team will create for whom and the value it will bring. Finally, you will present a proposal to your class and the community for feedback and refinement of your design direction.

| Tasks |
| :--- |
| **Complete the trivia app code experiments.**<br>Each team member complete the experiments to develop a firm understanding of the opportunities and constraints your team will have with your design. | 
| **Complete a competitive analysis.** <br>Each team member contribute one competitive analysis of a trivia game and synthesize findings from the code template experiments.| 
| **Research health issues related to your community.**<br>Each team member will research at least one health issue to understand the scope of each problem (like trends, statistics, and causal relationships) and the opportunities to affect public awareness. The team can share findings to consider how the trivia game may engage these topics. | 
| **Develop pesonas based on interviews.**<br>Conduct interviews in order to develop personas, one for each team member, that describe the frustrations of stakeholders and opportunities to support meaningful change.| 
| **Sketch initial interaction storyboards.**<br>Each team member create a unique design concept based on your understanding about the stakeholders, the trivia code, and a health topic. | 
| **Compose a clear problem statement.**<br>As a team, review all of your work and discuss several possible problem statement before settling in on one single problem statement. You will want this statement to be clear, consise, and compelling. It should be supported by your research and analysis up to this point. | 
| **Prepare for your team proposal.**<br>Refine your artifacts to be included in your proposal submission. Ensure that they present a cohesive story that supports your problem statement and be prepared to discuss your team's work and ideas in more detail. |

## Phase 2: Design and Build Solution
Compose a prototype of the solution for a detailed internal review and evaluation by a sample of stakeholders. Prepare any other known assets that will contribute to the development in the next phase. Organize a development strategy to methodically create your solution with efficiency and quality. While executing the development, also prepare for the promotion and launch of the solution. Conduct several tests to ensure all is in working order before an in-class demonstration.

| Tasks |
| :--- |
| **Build your question bank.**<br>You will find that creating good trivia questions will take careful thought and multiple iterations. So getting a good start on your question bank will be very beneficial.|
| **Create refined mockups of your team's trivia concept.**<br>After careful review of your team's sketches and ideas, create digital images that represent examples of your different screen states that can demonstrate the game flow. |
| **Construct a prototype in Marvel App using your mockups.**<br>Provide enough visual and interactive detail in your prototype to allow thorough testing of each potential user scenario in your game. |
| **Complete an evaluation of your prototype.**<br>Each team member should evaluate the prototype by having three people individually play the prototype game. Synthesize your results and define important decisions for your trivia design before coding begins. |
| **Code a functioning app w/ questions**<br>Outline the features to program by priority and maintain well organized code. |
| **Create a marketing card.**<br>The marketing card will be a valuable lead-in to your game that could be distributed physically or as a digital image. Think about what your elevator pitch would be for the game and make it visual. |
| **Begin testing your trivia questions in the app in an orderly way.**<br>You may not be ready to get feedback on all the app interactions with the "bells and whistles" but you can get valuable feedback on the question and answer formulations. Are they clear and concise? Too easy? Too hard? Interesting? |
| **Prepare a development review and demonstration**<br>Take this opportunity to wrap-up your trivia app the best you can in order to begin testing your game in the next phase. |

## Phase 3: Evaluate and Improve Solution
After confirmation of the solution’s quality, launch and promote the work. Monitor the use of your solution and gather direct feedback from key stakeholders for minor improvements or recommendations for further development.

| Tasks |
| :--- |
| **Create an evaluation script.**<br>Plan how you will approach and prompt people to test your trivia app, followed by a clear method of record keeping. You want to learn as much as you can while using people's time wisely and respectfully. |
| **Execute your evaluation.**<br>Remember, you may want to adjust your evaluation plan based on what you learn from the early participants. |
| **Summarize your findings and draw conclusions about design refinements.**<br>It is important to determine how you can get the most return (improvements in the trivia game) from the time you have remaining to work.|
| **Make refinements to your trivia code and visual design as needed.**<br>Determine a plan to iterate through your changes with frequent testing to ensure nothing is unintentionally broken.|
| **Complete a question analysis.**<br>Prepare summary data and charts on people's responses to your trivia questions and draw some conclusions about the quality of the questions or people's general knowledge about each item.|
| **Prepare your poster.**<br>Your poster design is important for two reasons. One, it is an opportunity for your team to reflect on the project process and what you have learned. Two, it provides a great visual aid to explaining your work to visitors at the final event.|
| **Prepare for your in-class poster review and final trivia demonstration.**<br>This is a time to develop a clear narrative to share about your team's work and enjoy sharing it with others. | 1 Hour | | &nbsp; |

## Phase 4: Share Project with Public

Now is the time to refine all the details, review the process your team used to develop your app, and plan how you will tell your story to others.

| Tasks |
| :--- |
| **Refine your team's plan for presenting based on your in-class review and demonstration.**<br>|
| **Prepare an individual reflection document.**<br>Take the time to review the project process. What went well? What didn't? What did you learn about collaboration? What did you learn about your interests in the practice of designing, coding, and data analysis? What did you learn about personal responsibility? |
| **Present to the public**<br>Remember, a lot of people will likely be learning about your project for the first time. You will need to tell your story from the beginning in an engaging way. |
| **Celebrate the fine work you have done!**|
