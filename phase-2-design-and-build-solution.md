# 2. Design and Build Solution

Compose a prototype of the solution for a detailed internal review and evaluation by a sample of stakeholders. Prepare any other known assets that will contribute to the development in the next phase. Organize a development strategy to methodically create your solution with efficiency and quality. While executing the development, also prepare for the promotion and launch of the solution. Conduct several tests to ensure all is in working order before an in-class demonstration.

|  | **Build your question bank.** You will find that creating good trivia questions will take careful thought and multiple iterations. So getting a good start on your question bank will be very beneficial. |
|  | **Create refined mockups of your team's trivia concept.** After careful review of your team's sketches and ideas, create digital images that represent examples of your different screen states that can demonstrate the game flow. |
|  | **Construct a prototype in Marvel App using your mockups.** Provide enough visual and interactive detail in your prototype to allow thorough testing of each potential user scenario in your game. |
|  | **Complete an evaluation of your prototype.** Each team member should evaluate the prototype by having three people individually play the prototype game. Synthesize your results and define important decisions for your trivia design before coding begins. |
|  | **Code a functioning app w/ questions** Outline the features to program by priority and maintain well organized code. |
|  | **Create a marketing card.** The marketing card will be a valuable lead-in to your game that could be distributed physically or as a digital image. Think about what your elevator pitch would be for the game and make it visual. |
|  | **Begin testing your trivia questions in the app in an orderly way.** You may not be ready to get feedback on all the app interactions with the "bells and whistles" but you can get valuable feedback on the question and answer formulations. Are they clear and concise? Too easy? Too hard? Interesting? |
|  | **Prepare a development review and demonstration** Take this opportunity to wrap-up your trivia app the best you can in order to begin testing your game in the next phase. |
