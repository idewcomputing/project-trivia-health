# Skills & Exploration

It is highly recommended that you "round out" your learning experience by working on independent skills and exploring the breadth of computing applications as a supplement to your team project. Developing strong skills will give you the ability to jump into future work and contribute in a meaningful way, and intentionally exploring computing careers, innovation, and the people involved will reveal exciting opportunities for you, that may otherwise go unnoticed.
