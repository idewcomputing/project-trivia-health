**Design a prototype** of the solution for a detailed internal review and evaluation by a sample of stakeholders. Based on what you learn from your prototype, organize a development strategy to methodically **program and style your solution** with efficiency and quality. Also prepare for the promotion and launch of your solution. Conduct unit testing to ensure all is in working order before an in-class demonstration.
