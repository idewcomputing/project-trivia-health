After confirmation of the solution’s quality, launch and promote the work. Monitor the use of your solution and gather direct feedback from key stakeholders for minor improvements or recommendations for further development.

|  | **Evaluation.** Plan how you will approach and prompt people to test your trivia app, followed by a clear method of record keeping. You want to learn as much as you can while using people's time wisely and respectfully. Remember, you may want to adjust your evaluation plan based on what you learn from the early participants. |
|  | **Evaluation Results.** It is important to determine how you can get the most return \(improvements in the trivia game\) from the time you have remaining to work. |
|  | **App Refinements.** Determine a plan to iterate through your changes with frequent testing to ensure nothing is unintentionally broken. |
|  | **Question analysis.** Prepare summary data and charts on people's responses to your trivia questions and draw some conclusions about the quality of the questions or people's general knowledge about each item. |
|  | **Poster.** Your poster design is important for two reasons. One, it is an opportunity for your team to reflect on the project process and what you have learned. Two, it provides a great visual aid to explaining your work to visitors at the final event. |
|  | **Prepare for Poster Review and Trivia Demonstration.** This is a time to develop a clear narrative to share about your team's work and enjoy sharing it with others in class. |
