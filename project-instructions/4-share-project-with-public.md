**4.2 Individual Reflection**  
Take the time to review the project process. What went well? What didn't? What did you learn about collaboration? What did you learn about your interests in the practice of designing, coding, and data analysis? What did you learn about personal responsibility?  
**❏ Deliverable: A document clearly conveying your project experience, learning, and future interests.**
