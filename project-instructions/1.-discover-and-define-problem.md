# 1 Discover & Define Problem

Begin to frame the goals of the design by learning about the stakeholders, the available technology, the features of existing trivia designs, and the scope of health issues in your community. Develop some initial design ideas and compose a clear problem statement that defines what your team will create for whom and the value it will bring. Finally, you will present a proposal to your class and the community for feedback and refinement of your design direction.

| **âœ“** | **Tasks** |
| :---: | :--- |
|  | **1.1 Trivia App Code - Tutorial.** Each team member will complete the exercises in [**the code tutorial**](https://docs.idew.org/code-trivia/tutorial/overview-of-code-template) ****to develop a firm understanding of the opportunities and constraints your team will have with your design. **Deliverable: Demonstrate that you have completed each exercise in the tutorial.** |
|  | **1.2 Competitive Analysis.**  Each team member will contribute one [**competitive analysis**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/competitive-analysis) of an existing trivia game that is either available on the Web or as an app. Even though you are not investigating direct competition, you will find the analyses valuable in discovering good ideas that you may incorporate into your team's solution. Keep the context of your game in mind, because this may influence what features are appropriate for a game focused on a health issue. **Deliverable: Collect your team's competitive analyses into a single document or slide set**. |
|  | **1.3 Background Research.** Each team member will conduct [**background research**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/background-research) on at least one health issue to understand the scope of each problem \(like trends, statistics, and causal relationships\) and the opportunities to affect public awareness. It is important to look at each health issue through the lens of public awareness. How knowledgeable is the general public on the topic right now? How much could the community benefit from learning some key information through a trivia game? What is the potential for generating some social movement? Will you have access to the communities greatly affected by the health issue for further research and testing your trivia app? As a team, discuss all the research and determine which health issue will be your focus. **Deliverable: Collect your team's background research into a single document or slide set**. |
|  | **1.4 Personas.** Each team member will conduct two [**interviews**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/interviews) of people outside of class to understand their perspective on your chosen health issue and on trivia games. You will want to investigate the depth of each person's knowledge and passion about your health issue. You will also want to gather their likes and dislikes with trivia games and mobile gaming in general. As a team review your interview responses and use this information to develop [**personas**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/personas), one for each team member, that describe the context, needs, and frustrations of stakeholders, revealing opportunities to support meaningful change on your health issue. **Deliverable: Collect your team's personas into a single document or slide set.** |
|  | **1.5 Interaction Storyboard Sketches.** Each team member will create a unique [**interaction storyboard**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/interaction-storyboards) concept based on your understanding about the stakeholders, the trivia code, and a health topic. Each concept \(interaction storyboard sketch\) should contain four screen sketches that represent the welcome screen, question screen, correct answer feedback, and incorrect answer feedback. **Deliverable: Collect your team's storyboard sketches into a single document or slide set**. |
|  | **1.6 Problem Statement.** As a team, review all of your work and discuss several possible problem statements before settling in on one single [**problem statement**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/problem-statements). You will want this statement to be clear, concise, and compelling. It should be supported by your research and analysis up to this point. **Deliverable: A single page document or slide with your team's problem statement in large font.** |
|  | **1.7 Team Proposal.** Refine your work to be included in your [**proposa**l](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/concept-proposals). Ensure that each item contributes to a cohesive story and be prepared to discuss your team's work and ideas in more detail. **Deliverable: A collection of slides with the proposal content outlined below.** |
