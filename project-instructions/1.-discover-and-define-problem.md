# 1 Discover & Define Problem

Begin to frame the goals of the design by learning about the stakeholders, the available technology, the features of existing trivia designs, and the scope of health issues in your community. Develop some initial design ideas and compose a clear problem statement that defines what your team will create for whom and the value it will bring. Finally, you will present a proposal to your class and the community for feedback and refinement of your design direction.

|  | **1.1 Trivia App Code - Getting Started Tutorial.** Each team member will complete the exercises in the tutorial to develop a firm understanding of the opportunities and constraints your team will have with your design. |
|  | **1.2 Competitive Analysis.**  Each team member will contribute one analysis of an existing trivia game that is either available on the Web or as an app. Even though you are not investigating direct competition, you will find the analyses very valuable in understanding features of good trivia games that you may incorporate in your teams solution. Keep the context of your game \(health issues\) in mind as well, because this may influence what features are appropriate for your game. |
|  | **1.3 Problem Domain Research.** Each team member will research at least one health issue to understand the scope of each problem \(like trends, statistics, and causal relationships\) and the opportunities to affect public awareness. It is important to look at each health issue through the lens of public awareness. How knowledgeable is the general public on the topic right now? How much could the community benefit from learning some key information through a trivia game? What is the potential for generating some social movement? Will you have access to the communities greatly affected by the health issue for further research and testing your trivia app? As a team, discuss all the research and determine which health issue will be your focus. |
|  | **1.4 Personas.** Each team member will conduct two interviews of people outside of class to understand their perspective on your chosen health issue and on trivia games. You will want to investigate the depth of each person's knowledge and passion about your health issue. You will also want to gather their likes and dislikes with trivia games and mobile gaming in general. As a team review your interview responses and use this information to develop personas, one for each team member, that describe the context, needs, and frustrations of stakeholders, revealing opportunities to support meaningful change on your health issue. |
|  | **1.5 Storyboard Sketches.** Each team member create a unique design concept based on your understanding about the stakeholders, the trivia code, and a health topic. |
|  | **1.6 Problem Statement.** As a team, review all of your work and discuss several possible problem statement before settling in on one single problem statement. You will want this statement to be clear, concise, and compelling. It should be supported by your research and analysis up to this point. |
|  | **1.7 Team Proposal.** Refine your work to be included in your proposal. Ensure that each item contributes to a cohesive story and be prepared to discuss your team's work and ideas in more detail. |
