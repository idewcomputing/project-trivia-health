# 3.4 Poster



{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Your poster design is important for two reasons. One, it is an opportunity for your team to reflect on the project process and what you have learned, and two, it provides a great visual aid for explaining your work to visitors at the final event. Highlight at least six artifacts that demonstrate key work your team completed in the project process from beginning to end, and include a refined value statement that pulls it all together.

#### POSTER TEMPLATE <a id="poster-template"></a>

* You can use this [Google Drawing template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L81WNIn5YMEQ9TlcliLTdiCO-KwnzWIsXBGnqdumzzo) which is set to 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall. Zoom in or out as needed to add text, images, etc. – but do **not** change the canvas size.
* If you use a different drawing/illustration tool, set the canvas size to 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall at 300 pixels per inch \(10800 pixels wide by 7200 pixels tall\).
* If your teacher has specified a different size for the poster, use that instead.

### Poster Components

The poster template below is only an example to inspire you on how text and images could be inserted for each element. You want to make your own poster design, but make it coherent and easy to follow. Also, your version may not have as many artifacts or sections as this.

The layout was coherent and helps the team tell the story of what they have done. The colors and fonts were chosen with an appropriate size and contrast for easy viewing. | The poster is exceptionally organized and offers a clear and concise overview of what the team accomplished. The style of the poster is very engaging and clearly reflects the the theme of the final product.  |
