# 3.4 Poster



{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Your poster design is important for two reasons. One, it is an opportunity for your team to reflect on the project process and what you have learned, and two, it provides a great visual aid for explaining your work to visitors at the final event. Highlight at least six artifacts that demonstrate key work your team completed in the project process from beginning to end, and include a refined value statement that pulls it all together.

#### POSTER TEMPLATE <a id="poster-template"></a>

* You can use this [Google Drawing template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L81WNIn5YMEQ9TlcliLTdiCO-KwnzWIsXBGnqdumzzo) which is set to 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall. Zoom in or out as needed to add text, images, etc. – but do **not** change the canvas size.
* If you use a different drawing/illustration tool, set the canvas size to 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall at 300 pixels per inch \(10800 pixels wide by 7200 pixels tall\).
* If your teacher has specified a different size for the poster, use that instead.

**❏ Deliverable**  
A PDF file of poster \(36" x 24"\).
