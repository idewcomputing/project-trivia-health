# 3.3 App Refinements



{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
It is important to determine how you can get the most return \(improvements in the trivia game\) from the time you have remaining to work. So, based on your evaluation findings and question analysis, determine a plan to implement improvements while frequently testing to ensure nothing is unintentionally broken. Similar to your code requirements document earlier, simply list items by priority--high priority changes and low priority changes.

**❏ Deliverable**  
A document or slide listing improvements by priority.
