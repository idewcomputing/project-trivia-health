# 2.2 Interface Mockups

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
After careful review of your team's sketches and ideas \(from 1.5\), agree on the main game features and the visual theme of your team's design. Then create digital interface mockups that represent your different screen states that can demonstrate the game flow. These mockups will be used in the next step to create an interactive prototype.

If your team is has having difficulty agreeing on a design direction, determine a plan to come to a decision. Maybe, instead of one mockup, you make two or three unique mockups to compare before deciding.

**❏ Deliverables**  
Five digital screen mockups \(or more\) that represent:

* the welcome screen
* the question screen
* the question screen on correct answer feedback
* the question screen on incorrect answer feedback
* the closing \(thank you\) screen once the player is done**.**

| **Interface mockups** are provided but lack detail, not demonstrating a unique visual perspective on the basic trivia template design. | The interface mockups demonstrate a thoughtful concept design and provides a good representation for ideas and feedback from participants. | The mockups are exceptional in representing and evaluating some novel concepts, or a couple variations of concepts are presented to compare. |

Provide enough visual and interactive detail in your interactive prototype to allow thorough testing of each potential user scenario in your game. We recommend you use [**Marvel App**](https://marvelapp.com/) to create your prototype.

**❏ Deliverable**  
A link to your working Marvel App prototype that uses your interface mockups.

| **A prototype** is provided but lacks detail to make the evaluation fruitful, not demonstrating a unique visual or interactive perspective on the basic trivia template design. | A prototype that demonstrates thoughtful concept design and provides a good representation of idea for feedback from participants. | A prototype that is exceptional in representing and evaluating some novel concepts in an efficent way for participants, or a couple variations of a prototype are presented to test alternate concepts. |
