After careful review of your team's sketches and ideas, create digital [**interface mockups**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/interface-mockups) that represent examples of your different screen states that can demonstrate the game flow.

### **❏ Deliverable:** Five digital screen mockups that represent the welcome screen, the question screen, the question screen on correct answer feedback, the question screen on incorrect answer feedback, and the closing \(thank you\) screen once the player is done**.**
