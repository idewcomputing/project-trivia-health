{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Conduct some basic code testing to verify that the app is acting as expected under different conditions. Ensure that everything works as expected on different size screens and with touch or mouse interactions. Consider all the things a user might do, like double click, click and drag, swipe, change browser dimensions mid-game, etc.
