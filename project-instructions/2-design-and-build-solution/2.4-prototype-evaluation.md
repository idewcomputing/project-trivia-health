{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Each team member should evaluate the prototype by having two people individually play the prototype game using the think-aloud protocol. Synthesize your results and define important decisions for your trivia design before coding begins.

[_**Thinking Aloud**_ **from Nielsen Norman Group**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/).

**❏ Deliverable**  
A document or slide that summarizes the results of your prototype evaluation.

| **An evaluation** is presented but doesn't communicate any added value to the team's development process. | An evaluation that produces valuable insights on improving and developing the team's concept. | An evaluation that is exhaustive and thoughtful in collecting as much useful information from participants while be respectful of their time. |
