{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Each team member will conduct two [**interviews**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/interviews) of people outside of class to understand their perspective on your chosen health issue and on trivia games. You will want to investigate the depth of each person's knowledge and passion about your health issue. You will also want to gather their likes and dislikes with trivia games and mobile gaming in general. As a team review your interview responses and use this information to develop [**personas**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/personas), one for each team member, that describe the context, needs, and frustrations of stakeholders, revealing opportunities to support meaningful change on your health issue.

  
**❏ Deliverable**  
Collect your team's personas into a single document or slide set.
