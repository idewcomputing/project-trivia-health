Each team member will create a unique interaction storyboard concept based on your understanding about the stakeholders, the trivia code, and a health topic. Each concept \(interaction storyboard sketch\) should contain four screen sketches that represent the welcome screen, question screen, correct answer feedback, and incorrect answer feedback.
