{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Each team member will create a unique [**interaction storyboard**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/interaction-storyboards) concept based on your understanding about the stakeholders, the trivia code, and a health topic. Each concept \(interaction storyboard sketch\) should contain four screen sketches that represent the welcome screen, question screen, correct answer feedback, and incorrect answer feedback.  
  
**❏ Deliverable**  
Collect your team's storyboard sketches into a single document or slide set.
