As a team, review all of your work and discuss several possible design directions before settling in on one single [**value proposition**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/value-proposition). You will want this statement to be clear, concise, and compelling. It should be supported by your research and analysis up to this point.

**❏ Deliverable**  
A single page document or slide with your team's value proposition in large font.
