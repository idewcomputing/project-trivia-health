# 1.2 Competitive Analysis

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Each team member will contribute one competitive analysis of an existing trivia game that is either available on the Web or as an app. Even though you are not investigating direct competition, you will find the analyses valuable in discovering good ideas that you may incorporate into your team's solution. Keep the context of your game in mind, because this may influence what features are appropriate for a game focused on a particular topic.

**❏ Deliverable**  
Collect your team's competitive analyses into a single document or slide set.
