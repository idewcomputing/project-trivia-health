{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Each team member will complete [**the code template build tutorial**](https://docs.idew.org/code-trivia/code-template/template-build-tutorial) to develop a firm understanding of the technical opportunities and constraints your team will have with your design. Also, complete the steps needed to [**manage your own question database**](https://docs.idew.org/code-trivia/code-template/managing-the-question-db).

==&gt; [**LINK TO TEMPLATE BUILD TUTORIAL**](https://docs.idew.org/code-trivia/code-template/template-build-tutorial) **\(9 STEPS\)**

**❏ Deliverable**  
Demonstrate that you have completed the build tutorial, created a question database and can discuss how the code works.

**❏ Advanced Deliverable**  
Demonstrate that you have made modifications to the trivia app in the following ways.

1. Make at least three noticeable style changes to the game, likely done by changing the stylesheet CSS. [Here are some basic changes](https://docs.idew.org/code-trivia/advanced/code-mod-examples/style-changes-with-css) to consider.
