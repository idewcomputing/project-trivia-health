# Stakeholder Profiles & Narratives

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Each team member will conduct two interviews of people outside of class to understand their perspective on your chosen topic and on trivia games. You will want to investigate the depth of each person's knowledge and passion about your topic. You will also want to gather their likes and dislikes with trivia games and mobile gaming in general. As a team, review your interview responses and use this information to develop personas, one for each team member, that describe the context, needs, and frustrations of stakeholders, revealing opportunities to support meaningful experience with your topic. Each team member can also create a short storyboard that describes a "before, during, and after" story of how your solution provide an improved outcome. Here are templates: [Persona Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=102fkpkthbyqJ8BL3WYQGFdCmyEhbUHwhPHkYhbzszZM) & [Storyboard Template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Jmm9HhbxFbbBx91FSzXFE9Sm9J9908e-nQq0BGR49BE/edit?usp=sharing)
