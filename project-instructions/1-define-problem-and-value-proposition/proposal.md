{% tab title="✓  INSTRUCTIONS & DELIVERABLE" %}
Refine your previous work as needed to be included in your [**proposal**](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/concept-proposals) presentation. Ensure that each slide contributes to an explanation of a cohesive story that supports your initial concept and value proposition.

**❏ Deliverable**  
Your team's proposal as a collection of slides containing...

* a title slide
* your value proposition
* summary slides \(or exemplars\) of your team's work - likely not everything though.
  * competitive analyses
  * stakeholder personas
  * storyboard sketches.
