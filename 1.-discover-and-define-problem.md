# 1. Discover & Define Problem

Begin to frame the goals of the design by learning about the stakeholders, the available technology, the features of existing trivia designs, and the scope of health issues in your community. Develop some initial design ideas and compose a clear problem statement that defines what your team will create for whom and the value it will bring. Finally, you will present a proposal to your class and the community for feedback and refinement of your design direction.

| **âœ“** | **Tasks** |
| :---: | :--- |
|  | **Trivia App Code Experiments.** Each team member complete the experiments to develop a firm understanding of the opportunities and constraints your team will have with your design. |
|  | **Competitive Analysis.**  Each team member contribute one analysis of an existing trivia game and suggest potential app features that appear feasible based on code template knowledge. |
|  | **Problem Domain Research.** Each team member will research at least one health issue to understand the scope of each problem \(like trends, statistics, and causal relationships\) and the opportunities to affect public awareness. The team can share findings to consider how the trivia game may engage these topics. |
|  | **Personas.** Conduct interviews in order to develop personas, one for each team member, that describe the context, needs, and frustrations of stakeholders, revealing opportunities to support meaningful change. |
|  | **Storyboard Sketches.** Each team member create a unique design concept based on your understanding about the stakeholders, the trivia code, and a health topic. |
|  | **Problem Statement.** As a team, review all of your work and discuss several possible problem statement before settling in on one single problem statement. You will want this statement to be clear, concise, and compelling. It should be supported by your research and analysis up to this point. |
|  | **Team Proposal.** Refine your work to be included in your proposal. Ensure that each item contributes to a cohesive story and be prepared to discuss your team's work and ideas in more detail. |
