**4.1 Public Presentation Plan and Practice**  
Plan and practice your team's approach to do the following.

* Explain the function and value of your team's solution.
* Summarize major points in your team's process with the project. Sharing the value of each activity leading up to the solution. \(Be honest about what went well or didn't.\)
* Explain individual contributions or role in project, and a reflection of what you learned about collaborating on a team.
* Share your individual perspective on potential careers and how they relate to computing, and include specific pathways you are investigating, like other courses, college, or internships.

**4.2 Individual Reflection**  
Take the time to review the project process. What went well? What didn't? What did you learn about collaboration? What did you learn about your interests in the practice of designing, coding, and data analysis? What did you learn about personal responsibility?  
**❏ Deliverable: A document clearly conveying your project experience, learning, and future interests.**

**4.3 Present to the public**  
Remember, a lot of people will likely be learning about your project for the first time. You will need to tell your story from the beginning in an engaging way.

**4.4 Celebrate the fine work you have done!**
